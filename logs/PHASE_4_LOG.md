## [2025-05-14] - Task Update System Refactor

### Added
- `activity_task_updates` table for tracking task status changes and comments.
- UI support for viewing task comment history.
- Dynamic comment box toggle based on status (e.g., hides for "Done").

### Changed
- Moved all database interactions from controllers to model layer (`ActivityTask`).
- Enforced one-time edit policy after status update or mark as edited.
- Required comment on status change (except for "Done").

### Fixed
- Missing `status_comment` column reference removed.
- Unregistered `Database` class usage in controllers replaced with model logic.
- Status options visibility issue in dropdown corrected by explicitly passing options to the view.

### Notes
- System now maintains a full audit trail of all task updates.
- Inline comment field removed from `activity_tasks`, migrated to `activity_task_updates`.
